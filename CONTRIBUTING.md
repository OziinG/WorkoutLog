# Contributing Guide

## Branch Strategy
- main: release-ready only.
- develop: integration branch.
- feature/<slug>: new feature or refactor.
- fix/<issue>-<slug>: bug fixes referencing issue.
- chore/<slug>: infra/docs/non-prod code.
- hotfix/<slug>: urgent patch branched from main (PR back to main + develop).

## Commit Convention (Conventional Commits)
Format: `type(scope): summary`
Types: feat, fix, refactor, chore, docs, test, perf, build, ci.
Examples:
- feat(domain): add SupersetGroup model
- fix(store): handle corrupted active session file

## Pull Requests
Checklist (auto in PR template):
- Description & motivation
- Tests added/updated if logic changed
- 4-set & superset rules unaffected or tests updated
- Autosave/recovery impact stated
- Accessibility impact considered

## Code Style
- Swift 5.10+, SwiftUI first.
- Prefer value types (struct) for models.
- Actor isolation for session mutation.
- Keep views small; extract modifiers/components when >150 lines or reused 3+ times.

## SwiftLint
Configured in `.swiftlint.yml`. Run manually:
```
swiftlint
```
(If not installed: `brew install swiftlint`.)

## Tests
- Put unit tests in `WorkoutlogTests/` mirroring folder names.
- Name test files `<TypeName>Tests.swift`.
- Provide at least: happy path + one boundary (e.g., 3 vs 4 set rule).

## Versioning
- Patch bump for fixes, minor for features, major for breaking changes to public data contracts.
- Use `scripts/bump_version.sh <major|minor|patch>` before release PR.

## Active Session File Corruption
If an active session JSON decode fails: move to `Sessions/corrupted/<timestamp>.json` and start a fresh session. Add a test vector for any new corruption pattern.

## Performance
Before merging large UI changes, test with a mock session of 200 sets (add a helper in debug builds).

## Localization / Strings
Use raw strings early phase; before v1.0 extract to Localizable.strings.

## Accessibility
- Make tappable targets >=44x44.
- Use VoiceOver labels for custom controls (e.g., superset switch bar).

## Security / Privacy
No PII stored. Do not introduce tracking SDKs without notice.

Happy logging! ðŸŽ¯
